logic:

1. RNG turn order of players (Based off of # of players)
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random

	//create turn order # array(from 1 to number of players)
	//shuffle that array and put values into a stack
	//give value to player 1-N
		//just pop the next value from the stack

2. Shuffle cards
	A] "shuffle" the door cards and put them in the door stack
   	B] "shuffle" the treasure cards and put them in the treasure stack

3. Deal cards to each player
	--dealing cards based on turn order
		--need # of player/turn order max variable here
	--deal 4 door cards to each player
	--deal 4 treasure cards to each player

	door card #1:
		p1 gets 1 door card --> p2 gets 1 door card --> p3 gets 1 door card..etc
	door card #2:
		p1 gets 1 door card --> p2 gets 1 door card.....	
	door card #3:
		...
	door card #4:
		...
	treasure card #1:
		p1 gets 1 treasure card --> p2 gets 1 treasure card ...
	treasure card #2:
		...		
	treasure card #3:
		...
	treasure card #4:
		...

	check that each player has 8 total cards
		if total cards = 8
			continue;
		else
			if door cards != 4
				give door card
			if treasure cards = 4;
				give treasure card

4. Give control to player who goes first
	
5. PLAYER TURN
	A} Play/Equip cards [from hand]
	B} Recalculate player attributes
		1. Recalculate power
		2. recalculate totat power = power + level

	C} Draw door card
		IF FIGHT [MONSTER CARD]:
			--resolve fight
			if win:
				--level up player
				--check player level against 10
					if player level = 10
						WIN/GAME OVER
					else
						continue;
				--player receives treasure cards
				--option to equip/use new items
				--...go to card check... --> PART E
			if loss:
				--resolve escape (die roll)
					if 1-4
						bad stuff
					if 5-6
						escape (no bad stuff)
						adjust character attributes
				--option to equip/use new items
		IF NOT FIGHT:
			--resolve current card
				--any character impacts?
			--2nd turn ---> PART D
	D} IF 2ND TURN
		1. option to fight monster from hand (if player has any monsters)
			FIGHT -- see fight logic from C
		2. draw another door cards
			if FIGHT
				--see fight logic from C
			if NOT FIGHT
				--resolve card
					--any player impact?
				--option to equip/use new items
				--card check --> PART E
	E} CARD CHECK
		--check if the player has 5 or less cards
		IF card total >= 5:
			--pick cards to remove ... down to 5
		IF card total <= 5:
			--end turn


6. Change turn to next player
